# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Demo of R and its statistical test capabilities

## Background
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. The data analyst has been asked to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. 

1. Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
2. Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots,
3. Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population. 
4. Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
